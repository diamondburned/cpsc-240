// Program name: "isfloat".  This is a single function distributed without
// accompanying software.  This function scans a      * char array seeking to
// confirm that all characters in the array are in the range of ascii characters
// '0' .. '9'.  Further-  * more, this function confirms that there is exactly
// one decimal point in the string.  IF both conditions are true then a    *
// boolean true is returned, otherwise a boolean false is returned.  Copyright

// To students in CPSC240:  This is my opinion.  I have studied the the

//    LGPL is for use on software typically found in software libraries.
//    This LGPL license applies only to the specific function named in the
//    license. This library may be used within another application covered by
//    other licenses (or EULAs). This license requires that source code of this
//    function be distributed with the application (even if other parts of the
//        application are not required to be distributed with source code).
//    This LGPL allows you to re-distribute the function (provided the original

//    original LGPL remains). This LGPL allows you to distribute (or sell) your
//    modified versions to anyone (provided the original LGPL remains). When you
//    distribute this software to other people a copy of the LGPL is suppose to
//    accompany the source code in a

//        the license still has legal standing.

// A example: Microsoft programmers are developing a new version of Minecraft.
// One of the programmers on that project discovers a useful function stored
// online that can be used in the new version of Minecraft.  If that online
// function is licensed by GPL and Microsoft uses it, then Microsoft must make
// all of Minecraft open source and licensed by GPL.  However, if that online
// function is licensed by LGPL then Microsoft may legally incorporate the
// function into Minecraft, and Minecraft remains proprietary and wholly secret.
// Do you see a major difference between the two kinds of licenses?

//
// Purpose
//   Scan a contiguous segment of memory from the starting byte to the null
//   character and determine if the string of chars is properly formatted for
//   conversion to a valid float number.  This function, isfloat, does not
//   perform the conversion itself.  That task is is done by a library function
//   such as atof.
//
// Future project
//   Re-write this function in X86 assembly.
//   Added 2022-Aug-22: This function was re-writen from scratch, that is,
//   without reference to this file.  Feel free to download isfloat.asm
//
// How to call isfloat from an X86 function
//   == Declare isfloat to exist in another file: extern isfloat
//   == Obtain an address pointing to starting byte in memory.  Such an address
//   can be a register like rsp.  Also, the address may
//      be provide by the name of an array.   For example, "mystuff resq 300"
//      declares an array of 300 bytes,  The name "mystuff" may be used as the
//      start of block of memory.
//   == Do the setup block for isfloat:
//      == mov rax,0
//      == mov rdi, <a memory location>    such as mov rdi, rsp, or mystuff
//      == call isfloat
//      == The boolean result is returned in rax.  If rax holds exactly 0 then
//      'false' was returned, otherwise 'true' was returned.

// How to call isfloat from a C function
//   ==Place the prototype near the top of the calling function:  bool
//   isinteger(char []);
//   ==Declare a bool variable:  bool outcome;
//   ==Create an array:  char wonder[200];
//   ==Fill the array with a null-terminate sequence of chars.  Usually this
//   sequence comes from an input device like stdin (keyboard).
//   ==Call the function: outcome = isfloat(wonder)
//   ==Test outcome for true = "It is a float number" or false = "It is not a
//   float number".
